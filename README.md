# University Management System

A distributed university management system built with **Django REST Framework** and **ReactJS**, designed to manage academic operations, roles, payments, library services, and more. This system implements secure role-based access, supports multi-tenancy, and offers API-level performance optimization.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project was developed as part of the course **Sistemet e Shpërndara 2025** at the **University of Prishtina**. It ensures the separation of frontend and backend, communicating solely through HTTP REST APIs in JSON format.

This platform simulates a real-world academic administration system, where different roles interact securely with centralized services in a distributed environment. It can be extended for use in universities, colleges, or any educational institution.

## ✅ Summary Table of Main Folders

| Folder            | Description                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `backend/`        | Django project setup (settings, URLs, deployment entry points)           |
| `university/`     | Main Django app with models, views, API logic, permissions               |
| `frontend/src/`   | React frontend setup with JWT context, routing, and UI                   |
| `components/*Src` | Logical grouping of UI sections per user role for modularity and clarity |

---

This structure ensures a clean, modular, and scalable codebase for managing university operations across various user roles. It follows best practices for full-stack development with Django and React.

---

## ⚙️ Installation Instructions

### Backend Setup:

```bash
cd university-management
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # or env\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create the database in MySQL
# Login to mysql and run:
# CREATE DATABASE university_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser # (optional but recommended)
python manage.py runserver
```

> Ensure MySQL server is running and a database (e.g. `university_db`) is created.  
> Database credentials should be configured in `settings.py` or via `.env` variables.

### Frontend Setup:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

> Runs the app in development mode: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

## 🔐 Authentication

- Authentication is handled via **JWT**, using email and password.
- Token endpoint: `/api/token/`

#### Sample Login Request:

```json
POST /api/token/
{
  "email": "student1@uni.com",
  "password": "Password123!"
}
```

- Roles include: `admin`, `student`, `professor`, `secretary`, `librarian`, `finance`, `exam-officer`.

---

## 📚 Core Features

### 🎓 Academic

- Manage Students, Professors, Subjects, Exams, Grades
- Student Enrollments and Submissions
- Schedule & Attendance tracking

### 💰 Finance & Scholarships

- Monthly salary payments for staff
- Scholarship creation, application and approval system

### 📘 Library

- Add books, loan books to students, return tracking
- Library and librarian managed per faculty

### 🏛️ Infrastructure

- Faculties, Departments, Buildings, Rooms

Each role logs into a separate dashboard where they can manage only what is allowed by their permissions. For example:

- A librarian manages books and loans.
- A finance user manages salaries and scholarships.
- A student can view grades, schedules, and apply for scholarships.

---

## 🧠 Advanced Features

### ✅ Multi-Tenancy (TenantFilterMixin)

Data is filtered based on the user's faculty. Secretaries, Professors and Students see only their own institution's data.

This is achieved using a shared `TenantFilterMixin` that automatically filters queries based on the user's role and linked faculty:

````python
def get_queryset(self):
    return self.get_tenant_queryset(Student.objects.all(

### 🚀 Caching

- Grades and student-grade views are cached for 15 minutes to boost performance.

### 📄 API Documentation

- Fully documented and testable via Swagger at `/swagger/`

### 🧪 Unit Tests

Sample unit and API tests implemented in `tests.py`, including login, model creation, and API behavior.

#### Example:

```python
from rest_framework.test import APITestCase

class AuthTests(APITestCase):
    def test_token_generation(self):
        response = self.client.post('/api/token/', {
            "email": "admin@uni.com",
            "password": "Admin123!"
        })
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
````
